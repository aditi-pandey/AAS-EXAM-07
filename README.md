Case Study: Predicting Company Bankruptcy Using Financial Data
Objective: To perform an in-depth analysis of a financial dataset to predict the likelihood of a
company going bankrupt. The analysis involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis
(EDA), hypothesis testing, feature engineering and selection, and applying machine learning
techniques for classification.
Tasks:
1. Data Understanding and Preprocessing:
o Load and inspect the dataset.
o Handle missing values appropriately.
o Detect and handle outliers.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
o Generate descriptive statistics.
o Visualize feature distributions and target variable.
o Analyze relationships between features and the target variable.
3. Hypothesis Testing:
o Perform hypothesis testing to identify significant features influencing bankruptcy.
4. Feature Engineering and Selection:
o Create new features to enhance predictive power.
o Use dimensionality reduction techniques if necessary.
o Select relevant features using methods like RFE or feature importance.
5. Modeling:
o Split the data into training and testing sets.
o Apply Logistic Regression for classification.
o Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics.
6. Model Interpretation and Insights:
o Interpret model coefficients to understand feature impact.
o Summarize key insights and discuss implications for financial risk management.
o Provide actionable recommendations.

Deliverables:
 Detailed report of the analysis.
 Python code used.
 Supporting visualizations and tables.
 Presentation summarizing findings and recommendations.
Dataset:
 Provided financial dataset with 96 columns (95 features and 1 target variable).
 Target variable: Bankrupt? (1 for bankruptcy, 0 for non-bankruptcy).

Key Insights:
Positive Correlations with Bankruptcy Probability:

Borrowing dependency (0.278), Total debt/Total net worth (0.273), Debt ratio % (0.247), and Liability to Equity (0.246) show moderate to strong positive correlations with the likelihood of bankruptcy. This suggests that companies with higher levels of borrowing relative to their assets or equity are more likely to face financial distress leading to bankruptcy. Negative Correlations:

Retained Earnings to Total Assets (-0.255), Net Income to Total Assets (-0.256), and Persistent EPS in the Last Four Seasons (-0.256) exhibit moderate negative correlations with bankruptcy probability. Companies with higher retained earnings, net income, and persistent earnings per share (EPS) relative to their total assets tend to have lower risks of bankruptcy. These metrics indicate stronger financial health and profitability. Financial Health Indicators:

Ratios related to profitability (e.g., net income), asset management (e.g., total assets), and financial leverage (e.g., debt ratios) are crucial in assessing bankruptcy risk. Companies should maintain healthy levels of profitability, manage debt effectively, and strengthen asset management practices to mitigate bankruptcy risk. Implications for Financial Risk Management: Early Warning Signs:

Monitoring borrowing dependency, debt ratios, and liability to equity ratios can serve as early warning signs of potential financial distress. Financial managers should regularly assess these ratios to identify companies at higher risk of bankruptcy. Strategic Financial Planning:

Emphasize strategies to reduce borrowing dependency and optimize debt levels relative to assets and equity. This includes refinancing debts at favorable terms, negotiating with creditors, and diversifying funding sources to enhance financial stability. Profitability and Efficiency:

Focus on improving profitability metrics such as net income and retained earnings. Enhancing operational efficiency and cost management can bolster financial resilience against economic downturns or market volatility. Scenario Analysis and Stress Testing:

Conduct scenario analyses to evaluate the impact of adverse economic conditions or market shocks on financial ratios. Stress testing helps identify vulnerabilities and prepares contingency plans to mitigate potential risks. Actionable Recommendations: Enhance Financial Reporting and Transparency:

Improve transparency in financial reporting to accurately reflect borrowing levels, debt structures, and profitability metrics. Clear and comprehensive financial disclosures facilitate informed decision-making and risk assessment. Implement Robust Risk Management Practices:

Develop and implement robust risk management frameworks that integrate quantitative analysis of financial ratios with qualitative assessments of market conditions and operational risks. Invest in Data Analytics and Predictive Modeling:

Leverage advanced data analytics and predictive modeling techniques to enhance bankruptcy prediction capabilities. Develop machine learning models that incorporate significant financial ratios identified through correlation analysis for accurate risk assessment. Continuous Monitoring and Evaluation:

Establish regular monitoring mechanisms to track changes in key financial ratios and update risk assessments accordingly. Continuous evaluation ensures proactive risk management and timely intervention.
